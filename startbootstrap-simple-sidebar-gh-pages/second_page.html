                                        <p>Diwali falls between October and November, but the exact date changes each year as it is marked by the Hindu lunar calendar. It lasts five days in total, with the festival of lights falling on the third days of celebrations, which is marked on the 15th day of the Hindu month Kartik.</p>
                                        <p>Also known as Deepavali, a Sanskrit word meaning “rows of lighted lamps”, it is one of the most popular Hindu festivals celebrated across South Asia.  
                                        The festival of lights that celebrates the victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance.
                                        It sees millions of earthenware oil lamps, called diyas, light up people’s homes, shops, public spaces and places of worship as part of celebrations which marks the start of the Hindu new year.</p>
                                        <p>For many Hindus, Diwali celebrates the return of the deities Rama and his wife Sita to Ayodhya, an ancient Indian city believed to be the lord’s birthplace, following a 14-year period in exile and a battle fought by Rama and his army against the demon Ravana.
                                        The demon had kidnapped Sita and Rama travelled along with Hanuman, the deity in the form of a monkey-man, to rescue her and kill the evil demons - as depicted in the epic "Ramayana". Their victorious return home was celebrated by lighting the kingdom with lamps.</p>
                                        <p>Diwali also celebrates the goddess of wealth and prosperity, Lakshmi. Some believes it falls on her birthday and the day she married Lord Vishnu.
                                        Many in India leave their windows and doors open and light lamps to allow Lakshmi to find her way into their homes.</p>

                                    <p>The immediate answer is sweets – and plenty of them. Indian sweetmeats, known as "mithai" are a cross between snack, dessert and confectionery. Chickpea flour, rice flour, semolina, various beans, lentils and grains, squashes, carrots, thickened condensed milk or yoghurt are normally used as base ingredients; to which cashewnuts, almonds, pistachios, chirongi nuts or raisins are added. Fragrant with sweet spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cloves or nutmeg, they're further blinged up with saffron, rose or kewra (pandan leaf) water, and silver or gold leaf.It's customary to exchange extravagantly decorated boxes of mithai, dried fruit, nuts or silver serving dishes with family and friends.</p>
                                    <p>Around a month before the festival starts, women get together in each other's kitchens in turn to make the all-important Diwali snacks. Snack-making is very much a social activity, with older women turning out a dozen or more items and young people keeping the tradition alive by making at least a few.</p>
                                    <p>Different speciality meals are traditionally cooked on different days of the festival, and these vary further depending on region. Generally speaking puris, traditionally deep-fried in expensive ghee and therefore rich in every sense, replace flatbreads; and are accompanied by a different dal, vegetable curry, fried titbits such as pakoras, collectively known as "namkeen" or "farsan", and a pudding on each day of the festival. Many, though not all, Indians continue to eat vegetarian at this time of year.</p>

                                    <p>Chanukah begins on the eve of Kislev 25 and continues for eight days. On the civil calendar, it generally coincides with the month of December.
                                    Chanukah is the Jewish eight-day, wintertime “festival of lights,” celebrated with a nightly menorah lighting, special prayers and fried foods.
                                    The Hebrew word Chanukah means “dedication,” and is thus named because it celebrates the rededication of the Holy Temple.</p>
                                    <p>The annual Hanukkah Torch Relay marks the beginning of the holiday in Israel. People line the road from the city of Modi’in to the Western Wall (Kotel) in Jerusalem’s Old City, passing a burning torch from hand to hand. The torch then lights the giant hanukkiyah (menorah) at the Western Wall.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>In the Jewish religion, Hanukkah is one of the few holidays that is not instituted in the Torah. It commemorates a post-biblical event: the victory of the Maccabees over the Syrian-Greek rulers of Jerusalem and the subsequent rededication of the Temple in 164 BCE.</p>
                                    <p>It also celebrates a miracle that accompanied this event: When the temple was rededicated, God miraculously made the one day's worth of oil burn brightly for eight days.</p>
                                    <p>The only essential ritual of Hanukkah is the lighting of candles. The Hanukkah candles are held in a chanukkiah, a candelabra that holds nine candles. The candle (shammash) in the middle of the chanukkiah is used to light the others.</p>

                                    <p>Sufganiyot (doughnuts) are by far the most popular Hanukkah food in Israel. Every year, Israelis eat a whopping 24 million of these calorie-heavy-sugar-covered-fried treats made especially for the holiday.</p>
                                    <p>Strawberry-jelly-filled ones are the most ubiquitous, but don’t miss out on the other fillings: halva, dulce de leche, chocolate, pistachio cream and more.</p>
                                    <p>Diets aside, Hanukkah foods are usually fried in oil to remember the Maccabees’ victory over their oppressors and that one flask of oil miraculously burned for eight days in the rededicated Temple in Jerusalem.</p>
                                    <p>Many dishes also contain cheese to celebrate Judith’s victory over the powerful Assyrian army (she gave Holofernes, an invading general of Nebuchadnezzar, salty cheese to make him thirsty, wine to make him drunk, and then beheaded him).</p>
                                    <p>The traditional holiday menu also includes latkes (potato or cheese pancakes fried in oil), svinge (traditional Moroccan Jewish fried fritter), loukoumades or bimuelos (fried honey puffs) and chocolate coins.</p>

                                    <p>Christmas celebrations start in Poland on the night of Christmas Eve (24th December, Wigilia in Polish).
                                    Families sit to the Christmas table as soon as they spot the first star on the winter sky.</p>
                                    <p>It’s customary to leave one empty seat with a set of plates and cutlery for an errant wanderer who might knock on your door and need something warm to eat. On Christmas Eve you shouldn’t refuse anything to the ones who might need your help.</p>
                                    <p>The Christmas supper begins with the breaking of the opłatek. Everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. They then share a piece with each family member.</p>
                                    <p>After dinner it’s the present time!</p> 
                                    <p>Christmas Eve ends with Pasterka, the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the new born Messiah.</p>
                                    <p>Christmas and the following holidays are traditionally occasions in Poland for visiting friends and relatives. In the ensuing holiday season also popular are such family pastimes as nativity plays, nativity puppet shows, seeing elaborate Christmas cribs (nativity scenes) in various churches.</p>

                                    <p>New Year (Oshogatsu) is the most important holiday in Japan.  Most businesses shut down from New Year’s Eve (Omisoka) until the 3rd of January, and families gather to spend the days together.  It is generally a time of feasting, gift giving, and wishing good luck for the new year.  While Christmas in Japan is widely accepted as a time for partying with friends and having romantic dates, New Year is very much about family festivities.  And food - lots of it!</p>
                                    <p>Homes and entrance gates are decorated with ornaments called “kadomatsu”, made of pine and bamboo.</p> 
                                    <p>The first thing to do on New Year’s day is to view the first sunrise (“hatsu-hinode”) for good luck, followed by a family feast.  Children look forward to receiving “otoshidama”, which is a tradition where adults give money in small envelopes to the children in their extended family.  As a child you are secretly ranking your adult relatives by the amount of money they give you.</p>
                                    <p>It is a tradition to visit a shrine or temple during oshogatsu (“hatsumode”), to throw in coins and wish for good health and happiness for the new year. The most popular temples and shrines, such as Tokyo's Meiji Shrine, attract several million people during the three days. Most impressive are such visits at the actual turn of the year, when large temple bells are rung at midnight, and “omiki” (holy sake) are offered to visitors.</p>

                                    <p> On New Year’s Eve “toshi-koshi-soba”, or buckwheat noodles, symbolizing longevity, are served.  Long may be your lives, like the noodles in your bowl… be sure to slurp them in!</p>
                                    <p>The centerpiece of the New Year feast is Osechi-Ryori, easily recognizable by their “jubako” or bento-style boxes with various dishes beautifully and neatly fitted inside.  Dating back to the 9th century, it includes various dishes which have a special meaning to celebrate the new year.  For example, “ebi”, or prawns symbolizes a wish for a long-life, suggesting long beard and bent waist.</p>
                                    <p>It is traditionally the women in the family who start preparing osechi-ryori from up to a week in advance.  Tremendous time and effort is put into each dish.  More recently it has become popular to pre-order them from famous restaurants and department stores as well.  Modern women are too busy to cook feasts for men (who proportionately consume more) anyway.</p>

                                    <p>Although Greeks do decorate Christmas trees, it isn’t nearly as common a practice as decorating boats. Boats are a powerful symbol in Greece of moving towards a new life. However, while they symbolized something positive, they also represented the dangers that the people could experience at sea. In Syntagma Square in Athens, there is always both a Christmas tree and a decorated boat.</p>
                                    <p>Greek families leave a fire burning to keep away the Killantzaroi. The Killantzaroi are goblins that emerge from the center of the earth and slip into people's homes through the fireplace. They are more trouble makers then harmful. They are believed to do things such as extinguish fires, ride on people's backs, braid horse's tails, and sour the milk.</p>
                                    <p>1st January, New Years Day, is St Vasilis's Day who is also known as St Basil the Great.  Gifts are exchanged on this day.</p>
                                    <p>People in Greece also celebrate Epiphany on the 6th January. In the Greek Orthodox Church, Epiphany celebrates Jesus's baptism when he was a man. It's also known as 'The Blessing of the Waters'. There are many events throughout the country where young men dive into really cold lakes, rivers and the sea to try to be first to get a cross which has been blessed by a priest and thrown into the water. Whoever gets the cross first is meant to have good luck during the coming year.</p>

At the night of New Year's Eve, the "Year" will come out to harm people, animals, and proprieties. Later, people found that the "Year" is afraid of the color red, fire, and loud sounds. Therefore, at the New Year's Eve night, people will launch fireworks, light fires, and stay awake the whole night to fend off the "Year".</p>
