	<h2>Celebration</h2>

<p>Diwali falls between October and November, but the exact date changes each year as it is marked by the Hindu lunar calendar. It lasts five days in total, with the festival of lights falling on the third days of celebrations, which is marked on the 15th day of the Hindu month Kartik.</p>

<p>Also known as Deepavali, a Sanskrit word meaning “rows of lighted lamps”, it is one of the most popular Hindu festivals celebrated across South Asia.  
The festival of lights that celebrates the victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance.
It sees millions of earthenware oil lamps, called diyas, light up people’s homes, shops, public spaces and places of worship as part of celebrations which marks the start of the Hindu new year. </p>

<p>Diwali, the festival of lights, sees millions attend firework displays, prayers and celebratory events across the world every autumn.Celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs and Jains for a variety of reasons, the main theme is the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil.</p>

 

<h2>Food</h2>

<p>The immediate answer is sweets – and plenty of them. Indian sweetmeats, known as "mithai" are a cross between snack, dessert and confectionery. Chickpea flour, rice flour, semolina, various beans, lentils and grains, squashes, carrots, thickened condensed milk or yoghurt are normally used as base ingredients; to which cashewnuts, almonds, pistachios, chirongi nuts or raisins are added. Fragrant with sweet spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cloves or nutmeg, they're further blinged up with saffron, rose or kewra (pandan leaf) water, and silver or gold leaf. </p>
<p>It's customary to exchange extravagantly decorated boxes of mithai, dried fruit, nuts or silver serving dishes with family and friends.</p>
<p>Around a month before the festival starts, women get together in each other's kitchens in turn to make the all-important Diwali snacks. Snack-making is very much a social activity, with older women turning out a dozen or more items and young people keeping the tradition alive by making at least a few.</p>
<p>Different speciality meals are traditionally cooked on different days of the festival, and these vary further depending on region. Generally speaking puris, traditionally deep-fried in expensive ghee and therefore rich in every sense, replace flatbreads; and are accompanied by a different dal, vegetable curry, fried titbits such as pakoras, collectively known as "namkeen" or "farsan", and a pudding on each day of the festival. Many, though not all, Indians continue to eat vegetarian at this time of year.</p>

<h2>Religious practice</h2>

<p>For many Hindus, Diwali celebrates the return of the deities Rama and his wife Sita to Ayodhya, an ancient Indian city believed to be the lord’s birthplace, following a 14-year period in exile and a battle fought by Rama and his army against the demon Ravana.</p>

<p>The demon had kidnapped Sita and Rama travelled along with Hanuman, the deity in the form of a monkey-man, to rescue her and kill the evil demons - as depicted in the epic "Ramayana". Their victorious return home was celebrated by lighting the kingdom with lamps.</p>

<p>Diwali also celebrates the goddess of wealth and prosperity, Lakshmi. Some believes it falls on her birthday and the day she married Lord Vishnu.
Many in India leave their windows and doors open and light lamps to allow Lakshmi to find her way into their homes.</p>

<h2>Celebration</h2>

<p>Chanukah begins on the eve of Kislev 25 and continues for eight days. On the civil calendar, it generally coincides with the month of December.</p>
<p>Chanukah is the Jewish eight-day, wintertime “festival of lights,” celebrated with a nightly menorah lighting, special prayers and fried foods.</p>
<p>The Hebrew word Chanukah means “dedication,” and is thus named because it celebrates the rededication of the Holy Temple.</p>
<p>The annual Hanukkah Torch Relay marks the beginning of the holiday in Israel. People line the road from the city of Modi’in to the Western Wall (Kotel) in Jerusalem’s Old City, passing a burning torch from hand to hand. The torch then lights the giant hanukkiyah (menorah) at the Western Wall.
Jerusalem’s Old City and the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak show why this holiday is called the Festival of Light. People from all over the country – as well as tourists from abroad – take a self-guided tour in the evenings during the eight days of Hanukkah to view the hanukkiyot flickering in window sills.</p>


<h2> Food</h2>

<p>Sufganiyot (doughnuts) are by far the most popular Hanukkah food in Israel. Every year, Israelis eat a whopping 24 million of these calorie-heavy-sugar-covered-fried treats made especially for the holiday.</p>
<p>Strawberry-jelly-filled ones are the most ubiquitous, but don’t miss out on the other fillings: halva, dulce de leche, chocolate, pistachio cream and more.</p>
<p>Diets aside, Hanukkah foods are usually fried in oil to remember the Maccabees’ victory over their oppressors and that one flask of oil miraculously burned for eight days in the rededicated Temple in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Many dishes also contain cheese to celebrate Judith’s victory over the powerful Assyrian army (she gave Holofernes, an invading general of Nebuchadnezzar, salty cheese to make him thirsty, wine to make him drunk, and then beheaded him).</p>
<p>The traditional holiday menu also includes latkes (potato or cheese pancakes fried in oil), svinge (traditional Moroccan Jewish fried fritter), loukoumades or bimuelos (fried honey puffs) and chocolate coins.</p>



<h2>Religious practice</h2>

<p>In the Jewish religion, Hanukkah is one of the few holidays that is not instituted in the Torah. It commemorates a post-biblical event: the victory of the Maccabees over the Syrian-Greek rulers of Jerusalem and the subsequent rededication of the Temple in 164 BCE.</p>
<p>It also celebrates a miracle that accompanied this event: When the temple was rededicated, God miraculously made the one day's worth of oil burn brightly for eight days.</p>
<p>The only essential ritual of Hanukkah is the lighting of candles. The Hanukkah candles are held in a chanukkiah, a candelabra that holds nine candles. The candle (shammash) in the middle of the chanukkiah is used to light the others. One candle is lit on the first night of Hanukkah, two are lit on the second, and so on, until all eight are lit on the eighth night.</p><!DOCTYPE html>

<h2>Celebration</h2>

<p>Christmas celebrations start in Poland on the night of Christmas Eve (24th December, Wigilia in Polish).
Families sit to the Christmas table as soon as they spot the first star on the winter sky.</p>
<p>It’s customary to leave one empty seat with a set of plates and cutlery for an errant wanderer who might knock on your door and need something warm to eat. On Christmas Eve you shouldn’t refuse anything to the ones who might need your help.</p>
<p>After dinner it’s the present time! Adults give each other gifts (or put them directly under the Christmas tree) and children, who had been absorbed by their food, find their presents hidden under the tree.</p>


<h2> Food</h2>

<p>It’s important to serve 12 dishes on your Christmas table which is linked to the number of Apostles. It is believed that you should try all of them; otherwise the next year food will be less abundant.</p>
<p>Among the 12 Christmas dishes you will always find some soup. Its kind depends on the region but the most popular ones are: beetroot soup (barszcz) with “uszka” (a kind of ravioli), forest mushroom soup and fish or almond soup.</p>
<p>In almost every Polish house you are bound to eat fried carp. The fish can be bought alive or already prepared for cooking.There is a superstition that if you put the carp’s scale in your wallet, you will be lucky and rich in the forthcoming year.</p>
<p>Other traditional dishes include: sauerkraut with forest mushrooms, sauerkraut with peas, pierogi (stuffed dumplings) with sauerkraut, jellied fish, kutia (wheatberry, poppy seed honey and nuts), herring in oil, moczka (gingerbread, beer, raisins and nuts) and makówki (poppy seed, honey and nuts).
</p>

<h2>Religoius practice</h2>

<p>The Christmas supper begins with the breaking of the opłatek. Everyone at the table breaks off a piece and eats it as a symbol of their unity with Christ. They then share a piece with each family member.</p>
<p>After the Christmas supper, many Polish houses will reverberate with Christmas carols.</p> 
<p>Christmas Eve ends with Pasterka, the Midnight Mass at the local church. The tradition commemorates the arrival of the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem and their paying of respect and bearing witness to the new born Messiah. The next day begins with the early morning mass followed by daytime masses.</p>
<p>Christmas and the following holidays are traditionally occasions in Poland for visiting friends and relatives. In the ensuing holiday season also popular are such family pastimes as nativity plays, nativity puppet shows, seeing elaborate Christmas cribs (nativity scenes) in various churches.</p>
